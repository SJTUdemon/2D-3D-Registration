# High-precision 2D/3D Registration Based on Biplanar X-Ray and CT Images for Surgical Navigation

# Introduction
This paper proposes a new 3D self-driven generative adversarial network model base on X2CT-GAN that can reconstruct 3D CT from two orthogonal X-rays, with significant improvements in the enhancement of 3D image boundaries, depth texture information, and contours.
